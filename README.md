# tic_tac_toe
This was the first ever project that I had submitted to my college during the 1st semester. I used the normal symbols available to make a tic-tac-toe board. I created various functions and called them in the main function so that the code would be simple to understand. I provided comments at the beginning of each function so that someone trying to figure out the code could understand it without delay.
